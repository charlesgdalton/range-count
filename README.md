## README

This is a Node.js program, so that's required to execute.

Also, to get dependency run
```
$ npm install
```

To run, execute the following command in your terminal while in the range-count directory:
```
$ node app.js
```

This will do a linear search with the array provided in the sample, a binary search with the array provided in the sample, and a benchmark of both against arrays from size 10 to 10,000,000.
